# Introduction to GitHub Copilot

In this learning module, we’ll explore the benefits of using GitHub Copilot, the first-ever AI developer tool designed to operate at scale. Copilot enhances your coding experience by assisting with tasks like testing, refactoring, explaining, and suggesting code.

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant that helps you write code faster and with less effort, freeing up more time and energy for problem-solving and collaboration.

By the module's conclusion, you will not only be able to articulate what GitHub Copilot is and its advantages but also comprehend its availability for individuals and businesses. Gain insights into the future of GitHub Copilot, and dive into hands-on exercises to master its utilization with Visual Studio Code.

By leveraging Copilot, developers have been able to boost productivity and accelerate software development.
