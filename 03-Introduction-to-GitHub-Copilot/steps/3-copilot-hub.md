## Step 3: View the GitHub Copilot tab with multiple suggestions

_Nice work! You just used AI code suggestions within a C# file by using GitHub Copilot :sparkles:_

Keep in mind that as you continue to use copilot, you may not want some of the suggestions GitHub Copilot offers. GitHub Copilot will show you multiple suggestions in a new tab.

### ⌨️ Activity: Add another C# method and view all suggestions

1. From inside the codespace in the Solution Explorer, right click on the project, create a new file. 

> Note: If you closed the Codespace from above please open it back up or create a new Codespace.

2. Select **Class** and name the file `Members.cs`
3. In the `Members.cs` file, type the following function inside of the `Member` class.
   ```
   public strin
   ```
4. Stop typing and view the Copilot suggestion by hovering over end the red squiggly grat text and select the `...`
5. Click `Open Completions Panel`. 

   > **Note**
   > If you don't see the copilot code block suggestion or the red squiggly and the three dots `...`, you can type `control + enter` to bring up the GitHub Copilot completions panel.

6. Copilot will synthesize around 10 different code suggestions or press CTRL+Enter. You should see something like this:

7. Find a solution you like and click `Accept Solution`.
8. Your `Member.cs` file will be updated with your solution.

### ⌨️ Activity: Push code to your repository from the codespace

Let's use GitHub Copilot to summarize our changes and then commit the code. 

1. Open the **Source Control** tab
2. Tap on the ✨ button in the **Message** entry for Copilot to generate your message.
